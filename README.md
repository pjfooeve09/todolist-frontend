# todolist-frontend
This app allows users to create a todo list. Users can create a new todo list and then create, view, modify, and delete items in their list. This app is written with a Rails API backend and Javascript frontend.

STRETCH GOALS

• Utilize the MVC framework: a list has many items, and an item belongs to a list
• Build a full CRUD that includes create, read, edit, and delete
• Use FastJsonapi to create model serializers
• Use Javascript to connect to Rails API using fetch
• Use fetch to implement methods that include: POST, PATCH, and DELETE
